You might know me as **derpeloper** or **nothonxhina**—I’d rather keep my full name off the internet, you know, stranger danger and all that. I’m a teenager from the Philippines, but I’ve been living in Dubai for as long as I can remember. Here’s a little peek into my life.

## A Little Background

I was born in the Philippines and moved to Dubai, where I’ve been ever since. I’m a teenager, and my days are mostly spent coding or writing stories. Think of me as that kid who’s either glued to a keyboard or lost in a notebook.

### The Slightly Serious Side (But Not Too Serious)
So, I’m this weird mix of chaos and focus. I code like it’s my job—well, it kinda is my job when I’m not just messing around—and I write stories that might one day see the light of day. I’m the guy who’s got a million browser tabs open, half of them Stack Overflow, the other half random plot ideas I’ll probably forget. I’ve got no fancy title yet, but I’m basically a teen tech gremlin with a keyboard and a dream.

## What I Love

- **Food**: Sushi is my ultimate happiness, and it’s all because of the **raw fish**. Seriously, huge emphasis on the raw fish—it’s the best part. If you’re not a fan, we might need to have a talk.
- **Hobbies**: I’m obsessed with writing. Books, stories, random shit—you name it, I’m scribbling it down. It’s my escape when I’m not busy with code.
- **Coding**: I code all the time. It’s my thing. I went from having no clue where to start to being a self-proclaimed tech wizard. It’s like a superpower, but with more screen time. 💀

## Personal Anecdotes (a.k.a. Embarrassing Moments)

- Picture this: I’m at the mall with friends, spot someone I thought to be another friend of mine, scream their name, run up, and hug them from behind. Turns out out to be a total stranger. Cue the awkward silence and me wanting to disappear.
- I’ve got two cats, one named Oreo (yeah, I know, super original). One time, Oreo decided my server rack was his throne and refused to come down without a treat. Who’s the boss here, really?

## Entertainment Vibes

- **Favorite Movie**: The Minecraft Movie, hands down. My go-to quote? “CHICKEN JOCKEY.” I yell it way too often, and I’m not sorry.
- **Music**: I’m hooked on **Chase Atlantic**. Their songs are *obsessive*. The vibe? Can’t explain it, just feel it.

## Travel Dreams

I’m all about places like the Netherlands or anywhere in Europe with tons of grass and greenery. There’s nothing better than listening to music on a road trip, staring out the window at calming, beautiful scenery. It’s my kind of peace.

---

## Proud Moments

- I’m proud of my coding skills (and my suffering). Started from zero and now I’m a tech wizard who actually knows what he’s doing. It’s been a journey!
- My favorite ways to waste time? Playing **VALORANT** or writing my stories. No regrets—time well spent.

---

## Things I Cherish

- The hair ties my girlfriend gives me. I keep them safe like they’re treasures—because they are.
- **Food I Hate**: The Dubai Kunafa Burger. Saw it on TikTok—smashed burger patty, cheese, and a pile of pistachio-kunafa mixture. Nope, hard pass. Dubai Chocolate, though? That’s good, just don’t overdo it.

## My Cheer Squad

My biggest cheerleaders are a few of my friends and my girlfriend. She’s definitely the loudest—she’s my number one fan, no contest.

---

## Random Fact About Me

Here’s a shocker: I barely get any sleep, but I almost never drink coffee to stay awake. How do I function? No idea. Pure willpower, I guess.

---

## If I Could Master Anything

- **Speaking Another Language**: I’m moving to Denmark, so I want to learn Danish. It’s tough—my aunt failed the test five times before passing, so I’m already nervous. But it’d be so cool to nail it.
- **Better Memory**: My brain’s the size of a pea sometimes. I’d love to remember stuff easier instead of forgetting everything five minutes later.

## Funniest Thing I Did This Week

The funniest thing I’ve done all week? Uh, I don’t remember. Either it wasn’t that funny, or my pea-sized brain already deleted it. Oops.

So, that’s me—Dylan, the sushi-loving, coding, writing teenager who occasionally hugs strangers by mistake. If you’ve made it this far, why did you listen to my yap?
