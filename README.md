# im derpeloper

ive been working on discord bots since early 2024, over a year now. i have made 2 public discord bots throughout a year

> [GV] means that I've given up support for this bot for now due to other projects I'm working on.

- **Clyde -** This is a recreation of Discord's old chatbot, Clyde. 
- **private investigator -** This is a miscellanious bot, purely for the purpose of entertainment, or functionality. [GV]

------------

one of the primary projects ive been spending time on is **Plana**, a discord bot for the server [gg.kivoto](https://discord.gg/kivoto). **Plana**'s code will not be public, nor will have any functionality outside of the server.
